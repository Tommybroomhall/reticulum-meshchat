## 🔑 **UNIFIED IDENTITY SYSTEM**

### Master Key Derivation
```
Fingerprint Scan → Master Seed → All Keys & Addresses

Master Seed (256-bit)
├── Reticulum Identity (Communication)
│   ├── Identity Hash: 7bbc7ac838ba559e0ec2a5a0d8961334
│   └── LXMF Address: fadc5ac301c9a40f27f3d05c2eb2a421
├── Bitcoin Wallet (BIP44 m/44'/0'/0')
│   ├── Private Key: Derived from master seed
│   └── Address: bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh
├── Lightning Network
│   ├── Node ID: 03a1b2c3d4e5f6...
│   └── Payment Address: lnbc1...
├── Ethereum Wallet (BIP44 m/44'/60'/0')
│   ├── Private Key: Derived from master seed
│   └── Address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C2C4e4C4e4C4e4
└── GHOST Token Wallet (Native)
    ├── GHOST Address: ghost1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83k
    └── Staking Address: ghostval1...
```

### Identity Generation Process
1. **Biometric Capture**: Fingerprint scan provides entropy
2. **Master Seed**: PBKDF2(fingerprint_hash, device_salt, 100000 iterations)
3. **Key Derivation**: BIP32/BIP44 hierarchical deterministic wallets
4. **Address Generation**: All communication and financial addresses derived
5. **Secure Storage**: Encrypted with fingerprint-derived key

### Technical Implementation
```cpp
class GhostGridIdentity {
    struct MasterIdentity {
        bytes32 master_seed;
        ReticuumIdentity reticulum_id;
        BitcoinWallet btc_wallet;
        EthereumWallet eth_wallet;
        LightningWallet lightning_wallet;
        GhostWallet ghost_wallet;
    };

    MasterIdentity generateFromFingerprint(fingerprint_data) {
        // Derive master seed from biometric
        master_seed = PBKDF2(fingerprint_data, device_salt, 100000);

        // Generate Reticulum identity for communication
        reticulum_private_key = HKDF(master_seed, "reticulum-identity");
        reticulum_id = ReticuumIdentity(reticulum_private_key);

        // Generate Bitcoin wallet (BIP44 m/44'/0'/0'/0/0)
        btc_private_key = deriveKey(master_seed, "m/44'/0'/0'/0/0");
        btc_wallet = BitcoinWallet(btc_private_key);

        // Generate Ethereum wallet (BIP44 m/44'/60'/0'/0/0)
        eth_private_key = deriveKey(master_seed, "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0");
        eth_wallet = EthereumWallet(eth_private_key);

        // Generate Lightning Network identity
        lightning_private_key = deriveKey(master_seed, "lightning-node");
        lightning_wallet = LightningWallet(lightning_private_key);

        // Generate GHOST token wallet
        ghost_private_key = deriveKey(master_seed, "ghost-token");
        ghost_wallet = GhostWallet(ghost_private_key);

        return MasterIdentity{
            master_seed, reticulum_id, btc_wallet,
            eth_wallet, lightning_wallet, ghost_wallet
        };
    }
};
```
